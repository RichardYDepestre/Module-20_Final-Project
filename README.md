# Data-Science-Final-Project

# Project Topic:

## Our topic will be FIFA World Players of 2019

We chose this topic because we were guided by the dataset which will allow us to analyze each individual players performance compared with their peers.

## Data

We will be working with fifa-world-players_full-specs.csv 

The source of data is from Kaggle website, is a public web-based data-science environment. The fifa-world-players_full-specs.csv

The dataset has a lot of features, the dataset contents allow us to apply the transformation mechanisms to a clean format, and we all have a common passion for the game.

## The question we want to answer are:

Does a contract of a player influence their performance?
* Does longevitity in team make them a better player or not?
* Does ball controller and being an aggressive make a better player?
* Does reacters and attacker make a better player?
* Does consistant ball dribbling maked better tacklers?
* Are left-foot players more productive that than right-foot one?
* Do teams that can afford talented international players win more championships than those that do not?
