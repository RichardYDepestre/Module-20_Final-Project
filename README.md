# Data-Science-Final-Project

# Project Topic:

Our topic will be FIFA World Players of 2019

We chose this topic because we were guided by the dataset which will allow us to analyze each individual players performance compared with their peers.

## Data

We will be working with FIFA_World_players_full_data.csv. 

The dataset has a lot of features, the dataset contents allow us to apply the transformation mechanisms to a clean format, and we all have a common passion for the game.
