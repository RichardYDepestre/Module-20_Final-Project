# Data-Science-Final-Project

# Project Topic:

## Our topic will be FIFA World Players of 2019

We chose this topic because we were guided by the dataset which will allow us to analyze each individual players performance compared with their peers.

## Data

We will be working with fifa-world-players_full-specs.csv 

The source of data is from Kaggle website, is a public web-based data-science environment. The fifa-world-players_full-specs.csv

The dataset has a lot of features, the dataset contents allow us to apply the transformation mechanisms to a clean format, and we all have a common passion for the game.

## The question we want to answer are:

Does a contract of a player influence their performance?
* Can team managers predict a player value prior to negotiations?
* Does a contract of a player influence their performance?
* What stats make a player more relevant to a position?
* Are left-foot players more productive that than right-foot one?(possible removal)


## Communication Protocols

We are communicating through slack and zoom and google drive

## Machine Learning Model

It has been recommended to use Random Forest smapling as model and we may also use other models to help us answer our questions. To support the model choosen we will Python, Scikit-Learn, and Imbalanced-learn.

##  Database

The Database we will use PostgreSQL, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Psycopg2
