|**`PROJECT TOPIC`**| **Our topic will be FIFA World Players of 2019**|
|--|--|
||We will be working with Fifa world players dataset that we found on Kaggle website, </br>is a public web-based data-science environment: FIFA_World_players_full_data.csv.</br>We chose this dataset because: <li>it appears complete, it lists lots of player features,</li><li>its content allows us to apply the transformation mechanisms and cleanse the data,</li><li>and we all have a common passion for the game that may translate into a diverse analysis.</li><li>Does height, weight, or agility make goal keeper more likely to stop penalty kicks? <li></li> Does height and agility make every player more likely to have area ball accuracy?<li>|
|**`Questions our analysis seeks to answer`**| |
||<li> What player stats are most relevant to their position? </li><li>Does a contract of a player influence their performance?</li><li>What stats make a player more relevant to a position?</li><li>How many players play on their weak foot ?(possible removal)</li>|
